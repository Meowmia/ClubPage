                        <p>If, like us, you’ve been hammering Bicep’s debut album since its release last year then it’s
                            highly
                            likely that you’ve been dying to catch them perform live. That’s not even taking into
                            consideration
                            their hefty back catalogue that spans almost a decade with monster releases such as Just,
                            Vision of
                            Love and collaborations with the likes of Simian Mobile Disco and Midland. All taken into
                            consideration, we quickly snapped up tickets when it was announced that Bicep would be
                            playing at
                            London’s Printworks in November.</p>

                        <p>This remix of HOSH & 1979’s Midnight from The Blockchain will have you drawn in from the
                            start. The
                            rolling groove, playful vocals and hypnotic synths all come together to create one mighty
                            crowd
                            pleaser. Combined with an intense and euphoric drop courtesy of an arpeggiated synth and
                            expertly
                            cut vocals, the release continues to build until you realise your whole body is pumping.

                            What makes this release even sweeter is that this it is available as a FREE download from
                            Dear Deer
                            Music, a Kyiv based record label. Head on over to their Soundcloud to get your hands on it.

                        <h4>ELLEN ALLIEN LAUNCHES NEW RECORD LABEL – UFO INC</h4>
                        <p>Ellen Allien has just marked the launch of her brand new UFO Inc. label with a hard hitting,
                            two
                            track EP. Featuring the tracks UFO, which has been on heavy rotation in her DJ sets
                            throughout
                            the
                            second half of 2018, and hard-hitting acid belter Körpermaschine on the B-Side, it’s a solid
                            introduction to the raw and contemporary techno releases we might expect from the imprint.

                            ‘UFO serves a mediator between earth and heaven, i.e. the concrete dancefloor and a feeling
                            of
                            transcendental rapture – the kind of track that lifts you up from where you dance and takes
                            you
                            away
                            to new spheres’ – Ellen Allien

                            The title track is aptly named, with hypnotic synths and acid stabs, UFO is an
                            extraterrestrial
                            sonic journey that certainly fits with Allien’s vision for the label. Körpermaschine is a
                            raw,
                            industrial track with punishing percussion and and an unforgiving acid bass-line that sets
                            the
                            tone
                            for the harder and more brutal releases to come on the label.</p>
